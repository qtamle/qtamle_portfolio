## 👷 Disclaimers


**This is an ongoing project and it is not done yet**.
If you encounter any bugs it will be really helpfull if you could provide the origin of that bug, the browser you used and the device.

**This design was not made by me**.
All the icons, wallpaper and sounds belong to windows corporation, so there's nothing I've created here. All I did was copy and apply the design for the web.

**The music component is ~~broken~~ working**.
I've been waiting for the Spotify team to review my application for extension request, first review was mentionning the usage of old logo of spotify, they were right there is some guidelines about the graphics and I complied, second review said basically that there will not be enough user for that use case. I put all the code to the trash and start all over with songs played locally.

## ⚡️ Consumption

Since WindowsXp design was not really meant to be eco friendly _(thanks to the billions of linear gradients)_
I did my best to make it as lightweight as possible.

## 🎨 Webdesign

The original design was made by the windows xp team, there is nothing I've done here but copying it for my use using web languages.

The design part was pretty straight forward on Figma, I used it more like a place where I could put ressources.
You can still use the components created in the Figma Design they are free and no need to quote.

I used after that the docker image of windows xp, that helps a lot to see all the small interactions there is :
